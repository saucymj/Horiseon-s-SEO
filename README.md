# Horiseon's Search Engine Optimization

## Description

In this repository I have refractured the code so that is more accesible for optimized search engines. 

Before I edited the code the website had some problems with following the links in the header to the content displayed on the screen. It did not have a title so I added one so that it now reads "Horiseo's SEO" when you open the url. I made sure to edit the css file so that things flowed more naturally and had a better readability when opening the source code. 

## URL's
